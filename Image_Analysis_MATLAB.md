Line Spread Function (LSF)

A negative USAF 1951 resolution test target, R3L1S4N from THORLABS, was used for the calculation of Line Spread Function (LSF) from its image.

LineSpreadFunction.m MATLAB script was used to analyse the imaging quality of the optical system


Point Spread Function (PSF)

Fluorescent beads were used as samples for testing under the fluorescence microscope configuration, where those beads were considered to be effectively point sources and were imaged for PSF calculations. The specimen used for this case was L5155 from Sigma-Aldrich, - fluorescent yellow-green latex beads of mean particle size 30 nm, in aqueous solution.
